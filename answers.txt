Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: There are several benefits including branch testing and general version
control for the sake of debugging and having multiple people work on a peice of software 
while keeping their work up to date with the current main branch and easily merging the different changes.


Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an example.

Answer: A common field would be in medicine, specifically using it to predict whether someone will have a disease
based on underlying conditions, whether genetic or environmental.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and rebasing

Answer: merging essentially compiles all the commits for both files and tries to apply all of them in chronological commit history, which also preserves the overall commit history. Rebase however takes all the commits of the branch and sequentially applies each commit sequentiall on top of whatever is the current version of the base which is
often main.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?
